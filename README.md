```bash
openssl genrsa -out tom.key 2048
```
```
openssl: This is the command-line tool for using the OpenSSL library.
genrsa: This command generates an RSA private key.
-out tom.key: Specifies the file where the generated private key will be saved. In this case, it will be saved to a file named tom.key.
2048: This specifies the size (in bits) of the RSA key to be generated. A 2048-bit key is commonly used and provides good security.
